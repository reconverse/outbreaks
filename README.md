# outbreaks: a compilation of disease outbreak data

This package compiles a series of publicly available disease outbreak
data. Data can be provided as R objects (loaded automatically when
loading the package), text files distributed alongside the package, or
functions generating a dataset.

The following R datasets are currently available:

``` r
data(package="outbreaks")
```

Data sets in outbreaks

# Installing the package

To install the current stable, CRAN version of the package, type:

``` r
install.packages("outbreaks")
```

To benefit from the latest features and bug fixes, install the
development, *github* version of the package using:

``` r
devtools::install_github("reconverse/outbreaks")
```

Note that this requires the package *devtools* installed.

<br>

## Add your own data\!

### How to add data?

We will try to create a better repository and data submission system at
a later stage. The purpose of the current package is only to share
examplar datasets during the hackathon. Acceptable forms are: - as a
`.RData` files in the `data/` folder (recommended) - as a text file in
the `inst/` folder - as a function loading/assembling/simulating a
dataset

### Naming Conventions

We use the lower case throughout, and snake\_case (using underscores) to
separate words for the files and dataset names, so that for a `RData`
object, a new dataset woud look like: \`my\_new\_data\_RDataâ€™. Try using
informative names, typically using the disease first. Whenever
available, order fields as: 1. *disease*: mandatory 2. *location*:
optional 3. *year*: optional 4. *sim*: mandatory if this is a simulated
dataset; otherwise data is assume to be an actual outbreak 5. *other*:
(any other relevant information)
